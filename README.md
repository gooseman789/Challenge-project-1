# Challenge-project-1

## Description

- My motivation for making this project was to better understand how to clean up and understand code written by another person.  
- I made this to show the different ways to clean and shorted code.  This also shows some key accessability standards.  
- This solves my issues by giving me a direct guide of the different options I have.  
- The largest thing I learned from this project is how to go about using variables to increase the ease for the code.

## Installation

In terms of my manipulation of this code, I first looked through the index file to see if there any anything missing.  I found the images and symbols did not have alt text in place.  Afterward, I dove into the stylesheet to clean up the information there.  I first went to see if there were any full sections that were similar to others to eliminate excess.  I condensed those down to one section with multiple selectors.  I also looked for values that were repeated to add them as variables to the top of the sheet.  I also noticed there was not a reset sheet attached.  I ultimately decided against adding that sheet as I was unsure if it would change the appearance of the original page.  


## Usage

The usage for this website will mostly for referencing purposes in case I should forget how to correctly clean up code.  

## Credits

The code that I manipulated for this project was found from the gitlab repository named UCF-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC. 

## License

I used the MIT license.
